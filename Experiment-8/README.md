# Experiment 8

## Aim
To implement tab-based navigation and drawer navigation in an app, enabling users to switch between screens using both bottom tabs and a side drawer menu.

## Steps Followed
1. Created a new Flutter project.  
2. Designed the **HomeScreen** with `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Drawer`, and `BottomNavigationBar`.  
3. Defined multiple pages: Home, Search (with filter), Settings, and Profile.  
4. Implemented **tab-based navigation** using `BottomNavigationBar` and `_currentIndex` state.  
5. Configured **drawer navigation** using `Drawer` and `ListTile` items, linking Profile page with `Navigator.push`.  
6. Added a **search functionality** in the Search page using `TextField` and filtering a list of items.  
7. Tested the app to ensure smooth navigation and UI consistency.

## Expected Output
1. **Home Screen (Tab-Based & Drawer):**  
   - Displays a centered text: `"HOME PAGE"`.  
   - Accessible via **bottom tab** and **drawer menu**.  

2. **Search Screen (Tab-Based & Drawer):**  
   - Contains a search bar at the top.  
   - Displays a list of items (`Books`, `Pens`, `Goodies`) filtered dynamically as the user types.  
   - Accessible via **bottom tab** and **drawer menu**.  

3. **Settings Screen (Tab-Based & Drawer):**  
   - Displays a centered text: `"SETTINGS PAGE"`.  
   - Accessible via **bottom tab** and **drawer menu**.  

4. **Profile Screen (Drawer Only):**  
   - Opens from the **drawer menu** only.  
   - Displays a centered text: `"👤 This is your profile!"`.  

5. **Navigation:**  
   - **BottomNavigationBar (Tab-Based Navigation):** Switches between Home, Search, and Settings tabs.  
   - **Drawer Navigation:** Switches between Home, Search, Settings, and Profile pages.  
   - Smooth transitions between all screens without app crashes.

## Notes
- `BottomNavigationBar` handles tab-based navigation.  
- `Drawer` allows navigation to additional screens like Profile.  
- The Search page demonstrates a dynamic list filter.
