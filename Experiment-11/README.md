# Experiment 11: Fetch data from PublicRest API and display results in the app

---

## Aim
Build a mobile app that fetches wallpapers from a **Public REST API** (Pexels API), parses JSON into app models, and displays them in a scrollable grid with **loaded, empty, and error states**. The app also allows users to view wallpapers in **full-screen mode**.

---

## Materials / Tools Used
- **Flutter SDK**
- **Dart Programming Language**
- **Pexels API** (Free API key)
- **Visual Studio Code / Android Studio**
- Dependencies:
  - `http` for REST API calls
  - `cached_network_image` for image caching

---

## Steps Followed

1. **API Setup**
   - Created a free account on [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/).
   - Generated a personal **API key**.

2. **Project Setup**
   - Created a new Flutter project.
   - Installed required dependencies:
     ```bash
     flutter pub get
     ```

3. **Folder Structure**
   - `models/` → defines `Wallpaper` model
   - `services/` → `ApiClient` handles API requests
   - `repository/` → `WallpaperRepository` separates data access
   - `viewmodel/` → `WallpaperViewModel` handles state
   - `screens/` → `WallpaperScreen` displays wallpapers
   - `main.dart` → app entry point

4. **Model Creation**
   - Created `Wallpaper` class to store wallpaper data (photographer, thumbnail URL, full image URL).

5. **API Client**
   - Used HTTP GET request to fetch wallpapers.
   - Included API key in request headers for authentication.

6. **Repository Layer**
   - Created `WallpaperRepository` to fetch data from API client.

7. **ViewModel**
   - Managed app states:
     - `loading`
     - `loaded`
     - `empty`
     - `error`

8. **UI Design**
   - Displayed wallpapers in a **scrollable grid view**.
   - Added **pull-to-refresh**.
   - Tap to view **full-screen image**.
   - Showed **loading spinner**, **empty state message**, or **error message** based on app state.

9. **Testing**
   - Tested API responses and app functionality.
   - Ensured app displays wallpapers correctly for valid API key.

## Expected Output

- **Loading State:** Circular spinner shown while fetching wallpapers.  
- **Loaded State:** Wallpapers displayed in a **grid view** with images loaded via `cached_network_image`.  
- **Empty State:** Message “No wallpapers found 😕” if API returns no results.  
- **Error State:** Message with retry button if fetching fails (e.g., wrong API key, network error).  
- **Full-screen View:** Tap any wallpaper to view it in full resolution.
